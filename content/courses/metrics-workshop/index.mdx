## Workshop on Metrics

I will share templates for 37 metrics across all stages of the STLC and present a real-life example of applying these metrics to justify the decision to discontinue collaboration with a large contractor.

**Everyone who wants to add the 37 metrics templates for each stage of the STLC to their QA expert arsenal â€” join in!**

I will explain the real benefits of using these metrics, and each of you will create your own set for your current project or company.

This consists of 3 sessions with practical homework based on your projects and real-life cases.
